How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

2/16 10a - 
saved time by narrowing on the changed lines of code, instead of trying compare two full files and all lines of code side by side


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

2/16 11a - 
Save a lot of time, vs trying to do manual comparisons


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

2/16 12p - 
pros: oppty for structuring commits around logical points w/ significant updates, coherent notes on updates that are easier to follow/decipher later
cons: forgetting to do it


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
2/16 1237p - 
many programming and web pojects involved multiple, inter related files


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
2/16 109p
git log lets you see the full history of changes, with commit IDs and comments
digg lets you drill down more and compare changes between two different commits


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
12/16 147p
make it relatively easier to pin down which commit had the bug introduced and then use diff to find the line(s) of code that created the bug


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

nothing atm
