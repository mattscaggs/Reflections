When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
3/4 1237pE when collaborating with multiple people right away, esp. if working in shifts to rapidly produce a project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
3/4 1243p so you can continue working on various iterations of a new features, while others operate independenly on other stuff in the same code 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
3/4 
fork is a way to use someone else project as a starting point, or contribute to another project
forking only exists on github, so you have to clone it to play w/ a copy of the code locally
branches are the different paths from the master, allowing you to create and test new featuers w/out messing w/ stable code

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
3/5 idk, really no clue - best guess is if a contributor really screws the pooch and messes up something w/ the version on github
